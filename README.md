## üìù Assignment Parameters

### Running Java Code 

There are three small Java programs in the folder `ptI`. Right now, they are **failing all tests**, meaning that the output of the program does not match up to what is expected. Follow the instructions below, **check your output on your home computer**, and then double-check in the `Actions` tab that your tests are successfully passing. 

1. The program `Hello.java` should print the string `Hello, World!`
2. The program `Add.java` should print the sum of the variables `x` and `y`. 
3. The program `Counter.java` should print all of the numbers from `a` to `b`. **Note:** This program contains concepts you haven't seen yet. That's okay; try running the program and seeing what happens, then trying to mess around with the code to see if you can discover how to print from `a` to `b`. 

- [x] Complete Program 1
- [x] Complete Program 2
- [x] Complete Program 3

### [EXTENSION] Return to Binary 

Return to your answers from last week. **First, revise your responses based on any feedback** if you haven't already done so.

Next, think about what you now know about how positive integers and floating-point numbers are stored in a computer. **How do you think negative numbers are represented in binary**? And, importantly, **do you think this is the only possible way**? If not, think of at least one alternative. (4-6 sentences)

    
**Your assignment is complete when all your assignment parameters are met.**
